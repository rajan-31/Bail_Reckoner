### Problem Statement ID: 
SIH1702

### Problem Statement Title: 
Bail Reckoner

### Proposed Solution:
The Bail Reckoner will be a web application designed to simplify and automate the bail application process for undertrial prisoners. It will consider multiple legal parameters, such as the nature of the offense, the duration of imprisonment already served, procedural prerequisites, and judicial discretion.​
<br></br>

The backend system will map legal sections, including those from the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 2023 statutes (Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bhartiya Suraksha Sanhita, and Bhartiya Saakshya Adhiniyam), and special laws related to cybercrimes, crimes against women, and other specific offenses. The tool will help judicial authorities and legal aid providers identify bail eligibility based on statutory and judicial precedents.​
<br></br>

Complex Legal Framework: The tool simplifies the complex legal landscape by aggregating all relevant laws and judicial decisions into one platform, streamlining bail assessment.​

Timely Decisions: It helps judicial authorities make timely decisions by automating bail eligibility checks and presenting all required information in one place.​

Transparency and Fairness: The tool increases transparency in bail proceedings and ensures that eligible prisoners are not unfairly denied bail.​

Comprehensive Legal Database: Integrating multiple laws and real-time judicial pronouncements to automate bail eligibility checks is an innovative approach.​

Predictive Analytics: The system will use predictive analytics to estimate the risk of flight or interference in the judicial process.​

Eligibility Alerts: Automatic alerts for undertrial prisoners who have served half their prescribed sentence.​

AI-Driven Legal Insights: AI models that analyze case-specific data for more accurate recommendations.​
